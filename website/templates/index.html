    <h6><strong> HOW TO MAKE MONEY BUYING AND SELLING GIFT CARDS</strong> </h6>
    By: Walmart Fancyman 7/21/2020<br/></br>
    <p> WARNING. Try this method at your own risk. The purpose of this post is to explain how to make money by buying and selling gift cards. This method is being released to the public for the purpose of helping humanity in this covid-19 crisis. It is possible to make over $3,000 per month doing this method.</p> 
	<p>Discounted Amazon gift codes can be purchased on http://www.gameflip.com for as much as 20% off. After redeeming the Amazon gift codes into your Amazon account, you can then purchase Best Buy e-gift codes using your stored Amazon balance. The Best Buy e-gift codes can be sold to companies such as cardcash.com, giftcash.com, and raise.com for approximately 85% of the gift card’s value. However, be forewarned because some of these companies are shady. Also, Amazon will likely close your Amazon account, if they find out you're buying gift cards with your Amazon balance. Amazon will not reimburse for money lost in a closed account. One trick to avoid this is to use an Amazon account which has a solid history of normal purchase activity in addition to being at least two years old. Last, the source of the discounted Amazon codes on Gameflip.com cannot be confirmed; however, it is not illegal to purchase gift cards on the Gameflip website. </p>
